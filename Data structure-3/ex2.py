#Permutations of a String
#Problem: Write a function to generate all possible permutations of a given string.
#Example Input: permutations("abc")
#Expected Output: ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']

#Problem:  
#You are given an n√ón matrix of integers. A "magic box" is a 3x3 submatrix within this larger matrix where all the elements are distinct. 
#Your task is to write a function that identifies how many such 3x3 magic boxes exist in the matrix.
