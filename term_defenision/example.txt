# 1. what is queue ? 
A queue in computer science is a linear list of elements in which deletion and insertion work by FIFO methodlogy.
if we want to get the first element in the queue we use dequque method and if we want to insert an new element we use inueue method.
for example if we want to save a line of people or vehicles that are waiting for something.


# 2. what is hashmap? 
HashMap is a popular data structure in Java that uses the Map interface and a hash table to provide efficient access and manipulation of data based unique keys.
HashMap is a data structure that implements the Map interface and uses a hash table for storing key-value pairs.
for example: 
Imagine you have a physical phone book.
The name of the person (e.g., "Alice") is the key.
The phone number (e.g., "123-456-7890") is the value.
If you want to find someone's phone number, instead of flipping through all the pages, you go straight to their name (key) using alphabetical order or indexing, 
and instantly retrieve their number (value).


# 3.what is LLM?
An LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of machine learning model,
typically built on neural networks, that is trained on a massive amount of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language.
LLMs are capable of performing various language-related tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing text, translating languages, or even generating creative writing.
for example: ChatGPT as an LLM
Task: Suppose you ask, "What is the capital of France?"
How It Works: An LLM like ChatGPT processes your query, understands the context, and retrieves the answer ("Paris") based on its training data.


# 4.what is binary search?
Binary Search is a highly efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target element in a sorted array or list.
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, comparing the target value to the middle element, and narrowing the search to the half where the target must lie.
for example: Imagine you're playing a game where you have to guess a number between 1 and 100.
You start by asking, "Is it 50?" (the middle of the range).
If the number is higher, you eliminate 1–50 and focus on 51–100.
If it’s lower, you eliminate 51–100 and focus on 1–50.
Repeat until you find the number.


# 5.what os knn?
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and effective machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
It works by finding the “k” closest data points (neighbors) to a given input based on distance, and then makes predictions based on these neighbors.
