# Python-Command-Line-Application

This console application provides a set of simple operations that users can perform on input strings. It includes options to check if an input is a palindrome, if all characters are lowercase, if it only contains digits, if it exceeds a certain length, or if it is empty. Users can continue to select operations until they choose to exit.

## Features

- **Palindrome Check**: Checks if the input string reads the same forwards and backwards.
- **Lowercase Check**: Determines if all characters in the input string are lowercase.
- **Digit Check**: Verifies if the input string contains only digits.
- **Length Check**: Confirms if the length of the input string exceeds a predefined threshold.
- **Empty Check**: Checks if the input string is empty.
- **Exit Program**: Allows the user to exit the application gracefully.
